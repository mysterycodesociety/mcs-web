    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  
    <section class="lead-statement">
      <p>We expect all volunteers, students, and members to be kind, respectful and community centered.</p>
      <p>This code of conduct applies to participants of all ages, all events and spaces, public and private.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We are an organization for and by women, femmes, and non-men.</li>
        <li>We offer support, mentorship, and a community of sisterhood to our students and
        our volunteers.</li>
        <li>We delight in multi-level coding education.</li>
        <li>We commit to providing this education to people of all kinds, economic statuses
        and abilities.</li>
        <li>We are feminists. We recognize the historic and systematic oppression and
        marginalization of non-men, people of color, queer people, transgender people,
        people with disabilities, and poor people and we actively work against this
        structured oppression.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>...and we model these values in all of our interactions with and around our students.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Our Expectations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Honor and celebrate each other's differences in race, ethnicity, ability, gender
      identity, size, sexuality, religion, politics, and economic status.</li>
        <li>Be supportive of one another (and yourself!) especially in classroom endeavors.</li>
        <li>Be respectful of equipment. Respect the rules of the spaces we occupy.</li>
        <li>Do not be under the influence of drugs/alcohol while you are responsible for minors. Do not provide drugs/alcohol for minors.</li>
        <li>No violence of any kind. Bullying or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Reporting</h2>
      <p>
      If you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or notice that someone else is being harassed, please
      report it as soon as possible. You can make a report by or speaking with one of the
      teachers of the current class or email our organizers at
      <a href="mailto: mcs.grievance.committee@gmail.com.">mcs.grievance.committee@gmail.com.</a>
      We expect event organizers and volunteers to be alert and take appropriate action to
      intervene in preventing or stopping harassment and unacceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, this is a mandatory reporting state. Nebraska "require[s] all persons to report
      suspected abuse or neglect, regardless of profession"
      (<a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov">https://www.childwelfare.gov</a>).
      This means that all persons must report any and all of the following concerns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a student is currently in danger (abuse or neglect) at the hands of someone else.</li>
        <li>If a student is in danger of harming themself.</li>
        <li>If a student is in danger of harming someone else.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have concerns about a student that fall outside of these, please have a discussion
      with an instructor.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
      While this code of conduct applies to our classes and events, if you are being harassed
      by a community member outside our organized spaces, please, let us know about it. We
      will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community members seriously. We
      reserve the right to refuse an individual's attendance to any of our events or spaces
      based on the individual's previous behavior at our events or outside events, towards our
      members and students or people who are not members of our group in any way.

      We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At
      our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment
      complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will
      increase the safety of community members or the general public. We will not name
      harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
      </p>
