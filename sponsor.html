        While our curriculum is designed challenge the minds of our students,
        there are some puzzles we don’t want them to have to solve.
        One of our core values has always been accessibility,
        and some of the barriers to getting into code have nothing to do with the code itself:
        lack of access to technology, transportation, or even an empty stomach can stand between
        a potential coder and their ambition to learn.
        We do not charge our students any kind of tuition,
        so it is only through the support of our generous
        sponsors that we are able to continue with our vision.

          <p>Your support will feed our students pizza for 6-12 weeks of class.</p>
          <p>
            While pizza may seem like a perk, providing lunch helps students focus,
            and keeps us accessible for students who might not otherwise be able to take the class.

          We could not done what we have done without the generosity of our sponsors,
          and we will not be able to achieve all we want to achieve without partnering with more sponsors in the future.
          And we do feel our sponsors are partners with us in this mission.
          Sponsors visit our classes, come to our graduations, connect us with community leaders who connect us with more students.

            They have donated not just the space where we hold their class, but the support of their incredible staff,
            Chrome Books for the students to learn on, and a platform to find new students who may not have heard of us any other way.

            AIM is an innovative not-for-profit community organization that grows, connects and inspires the community through technology;

            AIM has generously donated laptops, set up with the programs needed to teach the students languages and frameworks
            we never had the technological oomph to tackle before.
