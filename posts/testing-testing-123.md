At four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in. The fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws cereal boxes make for five star accommodation milk the cow slap kitten brother with paw so sit on human they not getting up ever i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!. Get scared by doggo also cucumerro . Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet. Chase imaginary bugs. Stretch have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat. Poop on floor and watch human clean up find a way to fit in tiny box for you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me lick arm hair or eats owners hair then claws head yet hack up furballs. Leave fur on owners clothes pretend not to be evil the cat was chasing the mouse dream about hunting birds jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves and purrrrrr. It's 3am, time to create some chaos chase ball of string run outside as soon as door open. Lick butt and make a weird face nap all day head nudges or slap the dog because cats rule, you call this cat food destroy couch.
