Isn't that fantastic? Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.

In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. We'll make some happy little bushes here.

It's all a game of angles. Be brave. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.

Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Very easy to work these to death. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. There we go. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.

Let's build some happy little clouds up here. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Anyone can paint. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. It all happens automatically.

We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

We'll have a super time. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.
